# MSBD5014_DifferentialPrivacyProject

This project primarily aims to provide privacy protection for the Q12 query in TPCH.

In create_database, the three SQL files are designed to import data generated by TPCH into a MySQL database.

Let's first discuss the first Java class: queryResult.

This class is designed to retrieve data from a MySQL database and save the query result in a specified output file.

Secondly: AggregateData.
This class is responsible for aggregating data. It reads from the output file of queryResult and consolidates the data based on the user ID. After sorting, the final results are written to an output file.

Third: Exponential.
This class reads from the output file of AggregateData and implements the exponential mechanism, producing the final result.

Fourth: CombinedRunner.
This class is a combined runner for the entire process. It executes the above three files. Using different ε values, it runs the three aforementioned classes and saves the result of each run in a specified output file.

To run this class (with ε value, β value, upper bound, database name, query, and other related parameters pre-defined in the code):

`java CombinedRunner`
